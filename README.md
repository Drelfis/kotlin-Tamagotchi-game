### Mochie the Tamagotchi

in this Asignment we where tasked with making a tamagotchi game, Introducing Mochie the sheba, he is a simpe tamagotchi that allows for 3 simple actions, feed, play and wash, with a button for each. When you interact with one of these 3 buttons, the points desplaid, starting at 20 points by default. Each button will increase its own points, and slightly decreasing the other 2 actions points, for example if you feed Mochie, he will loose play and food points, but his feed points will increase.

The game has a simple start screen, that allows the user to tap anywhere on the screen to continue, aswell as text that has been animated to flash the words "Tap to Continue".

Once you continue from the home screen to the game screen, it will load the previous points that have been stored in the phones disc memory, aswell as calculates of you have been away for more than a full day. If the user has been away for longer then a full day then the points of all 3 actions will decrease.When the app is closed, it will save the current actions points and store them in the disc memory to be called later when the app is opened again later.

If the app is opened and the points it recieves from the memory are low, the immage of Mochie will change to a version of him that is sad.And when a button is pressed the picture will change respectivley,wash to a picture of Mochie bathing, Feed to a picture of Mochie digging and finding bones to eat, and play to Mochie running.

If the scores get low the button collor will chainge from the default blue, to a red, indicating action is required. Every time a button is clicked, the other scores will update, being displayed on the buttons lable, making it look alot cleaner than of there where text views on the screen.

I tried to implement gifs, but android studios builed in gif feature dosent seem to be working on android studios version Heachog, i also tried to use sink the gradels with new code, but it would often fail, so i had to resort to using static immages
